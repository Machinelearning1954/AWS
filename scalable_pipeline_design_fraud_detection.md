# Design of a Scalable ML Pipeline for Fraud Detection

This document outlines the design for a scalable machine learning pipeline to handle web-scale financial transaction data (billions of records) for fraud detection, building upon the conceptual prototype and scalability analysis.

## 1. Overall Architecture

The pipeline will leverage Apache Spark for distributed data processing and model training. The architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, suitable for deployment on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS EMR, GCP Dataproc, Azure HDInsight) or on-premise Hadoop clusters.

**High-Level Stages:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Load raw transaction data from a distributed file system (e.g., HDFS, S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage) into Spark DataFrames.
2.  **Data Validation & Cleaning:** Perform initial quality checks, handle malformed records, and apply basic cleaning rules in a distributed manner.
3.  **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing:** Transform raw data into meaningful features suitable for the XGBoost model. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and creating new interaction or behavioral features using Spark SQL and DataFrame operations.
4.  **Data Splitting:** Divide the data into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring proper stratification, especially given the imbalanced nature of fraud data.
5.  **Distributed Model Training:** Train an XGBoost classification model using a distributed training framework integrated with Spark (e.g., `xgboost.spark.SparkXGBClassifier`).
6.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model hyperparameters using distributed cross-validation techniques available in Spark.
7.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model on the test set using appropriate metrics for imbalanced classification (AUPRC, F1-score, Recall at low FPR) calculated in a distributed fashion.
8.  **Model Persistence:** Save the trained model and the preprocessing pipeline to a distributed file system for later use in inference.

## 2. Choice of Tools

*   **Apache Spark:** Chosen as the core processing engine due to its proven scalability, fault tolerance, in-memory processing capabilities for iterative algorithms, and rich ecosystem including Spark SQL, DataFrames, and MLlib. It directly addresses the memory and processing bottlenecks of single-node solutions.
*   **Spark DataFrames & Spark SQL:** Used for all data manipulation, feature engineering, and preprocessing tasks. They provide a high-level API for working with structured data at scale and allow for optimized execution plans.
*   **Distributed XGBoost (e.g., `xgboost.spark.SparkXGBClassifier` or `xgboost4j-spark`):** XGBoost is a highly effective algorithm for fraud detection. Its distributed versions integrate with Spark to train models on partitioned data across a cluster. This allows training on datasets far larger than what can fit on a single machine.
    *   This approach leverages data parallelism, where subsets of data are processed on different Spark executors, and the XGBoost algorithm coordinates the learning process across these executors.
*   **Distributed File System (HDFS, S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage):** For storing raw data, intermediate processed data, and final model artifacts. This is essential for handling terabyte/petabyte-scale datasets.
*   **Parquet or ORC File Formats:** Columnar storage formats like Parquet or ORC are recommended for storing Spark DataFrames. They offer efficient data compression and encoding schemes, leading to reduced storage costs and improved I/O performance for analytical queries and model training.

## 3. Data Ingestion

*   **Source:** Raw transaction data (e.g., CSV, JSON, Avro files) residing in a distributed file system.
*   **Process:** Use `spark.read.format(...).load("path/to/data")` to load data into a Spark DataFrame. Spark can infer schemas or use a predefined schema for robustness.
*   **Partitioning:** Input data should ideally be partitioned in the distributed file system (e.g., by date) to allow Spark to prune unnecessary partitions during reads and improve load times.

## 4. Data Validation & Cleaning (Distributed)

*   **Schema Enforcement:** Apply a predefined schema during data loading to catch structural inconsistencies.
*   **Null Value Handling:** Use Spark DataFrame operations (`na.fill()`, `na.drop()`) or custom logic to handle missing values based on feature characteristics and business rules.
*   **Outlier Detection (Basic):** Implement basic outlier detection using statistical methods (e.g., IQR) on Spark DataFrames, though sophisticated outlier detection might be a separate, more complex module.
*   **Deduplication:** If duplicate transactions are possible, implement deduplication logic using Spark transformations like `dropDuplicates()`.

## 5. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing at Scale (Spark)

This is a critical stage and will leverage Spark extensively.

*   **Timestamp Features:** Use Spark SQL functions (`hour()`, `dayofweek()`, `month()`, etc.) to extract temporal features from transaction timestamps.
*   **Categorical Feature Encoding:**
    *   **StringIndexing + OneHotEncoding:** Use Spark MLlib’s `StringIndexer` followed by `OneHotEncoderEstimator` for categorical features with manageable cardinality. This creates sparse vector representations suitable for XGBoost.
    *   **Feature Hashing:** For very high cardinality features, `FeatureHasher` can be considered as an alternative to control dimensionality, though it comes with the risk of collisions.
*   **Numerical Feature Scaling:** Use Spark MLlib’s `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` to scale numerical features.
*   **Interaction Features:** Generate interaction features using Spark SQL or DataFrame operations (e.g., `amount / avg_user_amount`, `frequency_of_merchant_for_user`).
*   **Aggregated Features (Window Functions & Joins):** Create features based on historical user/merchant behavior (e.g., transaction count/sum in last X hours/days for a user). This can be achieved using Spark SQL window functions or by joining the main transaction data with pre-aggregated summary tables.
    *   Example: `AVG(transaction_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY timestamp ROWS BETWEEN 30 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`
*   **Pipeline API:** Encapsulate all preprocessing steps (StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder, Scaler, custom transformers) into a Spark ML `Pipeline`. This ensures that the same transformations are applied consistently during training and inference.

## 6. Distributed Model Training (XGBoost on Spark)

*   **Library:** Utilize `xgboost.spark.SparkXGBClassifier` (from the `xgboost` Python package, which includes Spark support) or the `xgboost4j-spark` library if working in Scala/Java.
*   **Input:** The preprocessed Spark DataFrame, where features are typically assembled into a single vector column (e.g., using `VectorAssembler`).
*   **Parameters:** Configure XGBoost parameters, including those specific to distributed training (e.g., `num_workers`, `tree_method='hist'` which is efficient for large datasets).
*   **Handling Imbalance:** The `scale_pos_weight` parameter in XGBoost is crucial and can be set based on the class distribution in the training data: `(count(negative_class) / count(positive_class))`. Alternatively, if more sophisticated sampling is needed, distributed sampling techniques could be applied to the Spark DataFrame before training, but this adds complexity and requires careful validation to avoid information loss or bias.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Spark’s inherent fault tolerance helps in recovering from worker failures during long training jobs.

## 7. Hyperparameter Tuning at Scale (Spark ML)

*   **Tools:** Use Spark MLlib’s `CrossValidator` or `TrainValidationSplit` for hyperparameter tuning.
*   **Parameter Grid:** Define a grid of hyperparameters to search (e.g., `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `n_estimators`, `subsample`, `colsample_bytree`).
*   **Evaluator:** Use an appropriate evaluation metric for imbalanced data, such as `BinaryClassificationEvaluator` configured for `areaUnderPR` (AUPRC).
*   **Parallelism:** `CrossValidator` trains multiple models in parallel (for different folds and parameter combinations) across the Spark cluster, significantly speeding up the tuning process compared to single-node approaches.

## 8. Model Evaluation at Scale (Spark ML)

*   **Metrics:** Use Spark MLlib’s `BinaryClassificationEvaluator` (for AUROC, AUPRC) and `MulticlassClassificationEvaluator` (can be adapted for binary to get F1, precision, recall).
*   **Custom Metrics:** For metrics like Recall at a specific low False Positive Rate (FPR), custom calculations on the DataFrame of predictions and labels might be needed. This involves sorting by prediction scores and iterating, which can be done efficiently in a distributed manner.
*   **Confusion Matrix:** Can be computed using DataFrame operations (`groupBy`, `count`) on the predictions and true labels.

## 9. Model Persistence

*   **Spark ML Pipeline:** The entire Spark ML `PipelineModel` (which includes preprocessing steps and the trained XGBoost model) should be saved using `pipelineModel.save("path/to/distributed_storage/model")`.
*   **Format:** Spark saves models in a specific format (often Parquet for metadata and model data), which can be loaded back for batch or streaming inference.

## 10. Workflow Orchestration (Conceptual)

While not explicitly implemented in this step, for a production system, these Spark jobs (ingestion, preprocessing, training, evaluation) would typically be orchestrated by a workflow management tool like:
*   **Apache Airflow:** Define DAGs to schedule and monitor the pipeline.
*   **Kubeflow Pipelines:** If deploying in a Kubernetes environment.
*   **Databricks Jobs:** If using the Databricks platform.

## 11. Deployment Considerations (Brief Overview)

*   **Batch Inference:** The saved `PipelineModel` can be loaded in a Spark batch job to score new, large datasets of transactions.
*   **Near Real-Time Inference:** For lower latency, the model might need to be deployed to a dedicated serving system. The preprocessing logic from the Spark pipeline would need to be replicated in this serving environment. Spark Structured Streaming could also be used for near real-time scoring if micro-batch latency is acceptable.
*   **Model Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of model performance and data drift is crucial in production.

This design provides a robust and scalable framework for training a fraud detection model on web-scale data, addressing the key challenges identified in the scalability analysis.
